# ML Max

ML Max is a set of example templates to accelerate the delivery of custom ML
solutions to production so you can get started quickly without having to make
too many design choices.

## Quick Start

1. [**ML Training
   Pipeline**](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/blob/main/modules/pipeline/):
This is the process to set up standard training pipelines for machine learning
models enabling both immediate experimentation, as well as tracking and
retraining models over time.
2. [**ML Inference
   Pipeline**](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/blob/main/modules/pipeline/):
Deploys a model to be used by the business in production. Currently this is
coupled quite closely to the ML training pipeline as there is a lot of overlap.
3. [**Development
   environment**](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/blob/main/modules/environment/):
This module manages the provisioning of resources and manages networking and
security, providing the environment for data scientists and engineers to
develop solutions.
4. [**Data Management and
   ETL**](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/blob/main/modules/data): This module
determines how the machine learning operations interacts with the data stores,
both to ingest data for processing, managing feature stores, and for processing
and use of output data. A common pattern is to take an extract, or mirror, of
the data into S3 on a project basis.
5. [**CICD
   Pipeline**](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/blob/main/modules/cicd/):
This module provides the guidance to setting up a continuous integration (CI)
and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline, and automate the delivery of the ML
pipelines (e.g., training and inference pipelines) to production using multiple AWS
accounts (i.e., devops account, staging account, and production account.).
